## Instructions

### Fork and Clone the Repository
Fork the repository to your Github account and clone it to your local development environment using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd0013_cd2693_Exercise_Starter_Code.git
cd nd0013_cd2693_Exercise_Starter_Code
```

Next, select the lesson you want to practice. The sections below outline the lesson-specific instructions.

### Lesson_2_C++_Checkpoint Exercises

Navigate to the individual challenge sub-directory containing the **main.cpp** file. For example, change to the **challenge1/** solution directory.

```bash
cd Lesson_2_C++_Checkpoint/solutions/solution1/
```

Update the **main.cpp** file where needed, and execute the following commands.

```bash
g++ main.cpp
./a.out
```


### Lesson_3_Markov_Localization Exercises

Change to the specific exercise directory, compile the **main.cpp** file, and execute the **a.out**. For example, the command below will help you run the  **1-initialize-priors-function** exercise solution. 

```bash
cd Lesson_3_Markov_Localization/markov/1-initialize-priors-function
```

Refer to the **Guide-[exercise-name].ipynb** for the specific instructions on how to update the **main.cpp** file. If you need help, you can compare your edits with the provided solution.

```bash
cd solution
g++ main.cpp  
./a.out
```


### Lesson_4_Intro_to_PCL Exercises
